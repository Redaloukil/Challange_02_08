# Coding challanage : Pagination & Infinite scrolling 
In this react coding challange, we implement posts pagination and posts infinite scrolling using starwars api data.

## Pagination 
Widely used when the user is searching for something in particular within the list of content like Google. 

## Infinite Scrolling    
Widely used in social media and high data consuming platfrom as Pininterest , Instagram.

## Scenario 
In this simple frontend application i have 2 page : Pagination page and InfiniteScroll page ,each of the two page are fetching data from StarWars rest api (for the purpose of demonstration)

##GraphQl
In this app i didn't found the need to use graphQl,I was fetching the data from one endpoint only.


## Technologies
* React
* React Router
* Axios

## Must do 
* Redux ( Once the application grows redux is a must to handle the complexity of the app state).
